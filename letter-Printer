       Respected sir, 
                 We desperately need a printer in our office for microbiology incubating report purpose.
 We have to get the print from another office. In which it takes a lot of time, and many times the work is delayed. Please arrange a printer in our office immediately so that our work is not disturbed.
      
     
     Thankyou ,
